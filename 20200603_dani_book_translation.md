## About this book:

This book began life as a 'Peer-Assessment with Moodle Workshops' course, taught in the University of the Basque Country's teacher-training programme.

Since the initial course, other Further and Higher education institutions have adopted subsequent editions as a professional development tool. Aimed at university teaching staff, the course has been used widely to increase the quality of teaching and learning in these institutions.

Over the years, course participants have often shown an interest in having the course materials gathered into one volume, the result of which is contained in the present edition.

# Origins

## The villain of the piece

Around the turn of the century, I was a new teacher and still brimming with enthusiasm for teaching (yes, those halcyon days!). One day, two students from one of my afternoon groups accosted me in the corridor to ask me about something that was bothering them. They had heard whispers that the morning group were progressing more slowly than theirs, and had covered less course material. The two students complained that the morning group were "learning more than us". They were concerned that their exam would be more demanding than the morning group's. There's nothing new about students complaining, right? The thing is, one of the students, insisting that the exams be fair and balanced, said with a straight face that he had "the right to know less".

This expression certainly raised an eyebrow at the time. But the more I thought about it, the more I realised that it reveals a deeper, slightly unnerving, truth about our work. It's hard to imagine someone going to a concert, a cinema or a restaurant with a similar attitude _"Well pardon me! I am paying for this, but... I insist the band cuts their set short. I insist they don't show the whole film. I insist the portions should be small!"_ And yet that's the way it is in the classroom. When, for whatever reason, we cut a class short, the general response is one of delight. Likewise, when we utter the magic words "...well, we're almost out of time. Let's leave it there". There has never been a known case, anywhere, of students forming an angry mob, demanding that the class be completed strictly as planned.

In the eyes of our students, we are examiner first and teacher second. We like to think of ourselves a collaborators, working and learning alongside our students, but in their eyes, we are judge and jury. 

Professor Eric Mazur of Harvard University described summative assessment--the exam--as 'the silent killer of learning'. For many years, I too have felt that the exam as the villain of the piece. Though we are supposed to be teachers, we are regularly required to dedicate more of our energy to 'the exam' (and the varying roles it forces us to play), than to developing great learning experiences.

Discovering computer-assisted peer-evaluation has restored my faith in education. Preparing these Workshops has caused me to put it to the test intellectually **THIS ISN'T GOOD**. Nowadays, I feel that the design of each activity, and creating each rubric is worth spending time on. I see that it bears fruit. For that reason, I have tried to simplify the technical aspects so that they are not blockers for anyone who wants to jump right in. Likewise, I strongly believe that the goal is great peer-assessment, and not great technology. It should never become an obstacle.

# What is a peer-assessment Workshop?

In a paired activity assigned to students, rather than each student simply submitting the exercise, we also require them to assess submissions from other students. This can be in the form of a simple questionnaire, rubric, or some other framework provided by the teacher. Teachers have been doing this kind of thing in classrooms since the year dot, providing simple forms between pairs and calculating a mark by hand. Nothing new there.

# Where does Moodle come in?

Moodle is a free, open-source software platform that allows us to manage the above online. It handles the intials submissions and the later assessments in such a way that a student can peer-assess not only their partner's or group's work, but as many students as is required. Moodle will also help distribute feedback to students and handling the calculations required for grading the work. It will publish and share those results too. The teacher could, of course, do this by hand, but at the cost of a lot of extra work and an obscene amount of time.

# And when does it become indispensible?

When the system works out not just the average mark that each piece of work is being awarded, but also carries out the other part of the assessment: it works out a second mark for each participant--and can detect whether individuals are working in bad faith or apathy. Soon, the student cohort is self-policing. The community of participants, by way of the aggregated statistics, produces results akin to those that the teacher would award, and as such, the teacher is relieved of the traditional role of 'everyone-evaluator', police, instead simply supervising the assessment process and focussing on pedagogy. The **tens of thousands of calculations required** to get that result would quickly get out of hand. So much so that realistically, it is only a valid peer-assessed tutorial when it's supported by technology.

# How this book explains it

Each of you will have has your own particular requirements. Some of you will have tried to set up a tutorial previously and will have arrived with specific questions. Others will be totally new to it all. For that reason, this book starts from scratch, so that someone who has never tried to set one of these up can follow step-by-step instruction in how to do so. For more experienced readers, this book can serve as a reference; the articles and instructions are ordered chronologically, in the same order as they come up in Moodle to make the right information easy to find.

# There are two main barriers to learning:

1. Moodle is the most widely-adopted Learning Management System (LMS) in the world, due to its versatility and speed. However, these advantages come at the cost of the greatest weakness of the platform; its dull, text-based interface which is not very user-friendly. This can lead to beginners feeling confused, not understanding how the functions are labelled, and  being unsure of the layout of the screens and menus and so on. For that reason, it's essential that users take time to familiarise themselves with the interface. The learning curve is akin to that of learning a new language, in that the key to understanding its syntax and quirks is to practise non-stop.
2. The above said, non-stop practice demands a lot of trial and error. A MARGIN THAT YOU WILL HAVE ACHIEVED that is perfectly manageable for other Moodle tools. With these, we can **try things out and make mistakes in private** until we are happy with the result and can show it to our students. However, Workshops require a group of participants interacting continuously in order to see progress. This means that we do not always have the luxury of letting things go wrong as often as we would like. If we factor in that this is an activity that will generate a final mark--the most important thing for the student, and always with a degree of confrontation and interests for those in front of the teacher, we end up with something of a Catch 22: to learn to use it, I need to make mistakes, but I can't afford to make mistakes because the Workshop is so important...


For these reasons, I have focussed all my energies to make these pages something different from the cold documentation that our institutions usually prepare for us; and likewise the official documentation that Moodle provides. One the one hand, this book draws heavily from numerous mistakes and errors that I had to make in my drive to teach my students with Workshop. This meant that I had to put in double the usual energy and dedication  that the tutor usually has to put in. On the other hand, from the experience of the Teach Twice course that was taught in the University of the Basque Country, thanks to the trust placed in it by the Teaching Assessment Service, which believed in the project from the start. By solving the doubts and worries of the teachers who took part in the course, I was able to consider other viewpoints and uses of this tool that I would never have contemplated.

# Opportunities and advantages of Workshops

The main advantage is pedagogical. And it is that of the six cognitive levels that we invoke in our students (Memorization, Comprehension, Application etc. see Bloom's taxonomy) it is pacific between the doctrine that the Evaluation and Synthesis (creativity) ones the closest to **deep learning** and transformational. Academia always reminds us that by harnessing peer-evaluation we not only learn _more_ but that we also learn _better_. We have all, at one time or another while correcting exercises with our red pen: "What a pity. If only they could see some of these excellent examples, how much more they would learn"--and this is reflected in the fact that, it is while we correct work that we teachers learn most. In one subject I had to teach--about journalistic editing--I arrived at the sad and rotund conclusion that by stockpiling this role of heteroevaluator and not allowing the student body to participate in the corrections was robbing them--no more and no less--of that most valuable second learning opportunity. Let's give them back what is theirs.

The second advantage is the impressive scalability of the tool. Organising a Workshop for ten students takes a reasonable amount of effort, but doing it for 100 or for 1,000 doesn't really require much more. And if that was not enough, if you have created the Workshop once, you can refine it and re-use it as many times as you like. In our teaching institutions, they are always pushing us to design assessments that are at once formative, continuous and sustainable. Traditional contiuous assessment, based on practical exercises tick the first two boxes but fail on the third: we have a limited time and energy, and it leaves us with a model that doesn't scale easily, or apply to multiple groups of students. The postscript that we teachers all put to that demand for 'real' assessment is, without fail, resources: _not enough time_..., _large numbers of students_ etc. On the other hand, by organizing peer-assessed Workshops, far from being limited by the size of the cohort, the system actually becomes more reliable the larger the sample group becomes.

The third is a little more subjective:

After years and years of grabbing the red pen and correcting the same mistakes over and over, like Sisyphus pushing his boulder up a hill, the teaching illusion and vocation starts to wear thin as a result. On the other hand, the construction of a good rubric in that arriving at systematizing this tome of decisions there are after each assessment reprents an ongoing intellectual challenge. Throughout our professional lives, we have all met colleagues of both types of extreme profile: at one extreme, people who are admirable for self-sacrifice in the face of so many repetitve tasks; while at the other end non-conformists, motivated by the desire to innovate and the quest for an answer to the eternal question: _"How far can the rock climb the hill by itself before I need to start pushing?"_

Civilisations, and Academia(Education?), have arrived at this point thanks always to their citizens--and teachers--at both ends of that spectrum. And yes for the reason that this book has ended up in your hands, it's likely you fall into the second camp.

# Barriers to Entry

On the other hand, there are also pre-conditions or obstacles that have occasionally led me to advising against the use of Workshop to some teachers.

The first is that creating Workshops has to be seen as an incredibly profitable **investment** of time. But, of course, to invest it, you have to have it first. Trying to use Workshops as an emergency solution is a sign of not understanding its functionality. The return on the investment starts, according to my own calculations, around the third of fourth usage. If we factor in the time that you are spending right now reading this book, we could even say the fifth usage. Having said that, it is a guaranteed return on investment. Soon, you will be spending three hours in work to make something that would once have taken you twenty. Take my word for it.

The second is that the calculation of the final mark, and the control of the Workshop process requires a little knowledge statistics, or at the very least, not being scared of percentages. It does not take a professor of Probability and Algebra, or an advanced poker player--note the order--but sometimes if we are required to supervise by eye a barrel full of numbers to clarify, with a certain agility,  whether there are flagrant imbalances, obvious errors and inverted tendencies. The functionality of Workshop is based on the wisdom of the crowd(?) // the reliability that you get from increasing the sample //. If ask a question to two students, they may give me perfectly valid, but different answers. On the other hand, when I ask twelve students the same question their answers will tend towards the first. For that same reason, it is much more advisable to run five so-so Workshops than try to run one perfect Workshop. This is one of the foundations that much of the following work is based on. If you are looking for a totally objective, infallible measuring tool, you should look elsewhere. Likewise, if you are someone with an allergy to data and statistics, you should close this book at this page, gift it to a colleague, and go back to your red pen.

The third barrier to enry are the temporal conditions (boundaries??) of this type of group activity. Teachers usually permit a degree of flexibility when it comes to submission of exercises, particularly when we are seeking to build good relationships with our students. So, rather than different types of tibute--a small reduction in the final mark for the piece, a big smile, medical note etc--we usually let these things slide. At the end of the day, everything stays at home and we also are interested in maintaining a certain moral legitimacy or a closeness/empathy with our students. And the worst of it is, these creatures also take a degree of flexibility for granted. That being said, when you try to program a machine to manage the logistics of a cohort's peer-assesments, this changes drastically. Straight away, this will work like an airport. The boarding doors can perhaps stay open a minute or two for that tardy passenger, but once the plane has taken off, it's much more difficult for the place to come back for them. In the case of Workshops, whether you set it up for two hours, two weeks or two months, there will be transition times, such as time to submit the exercise, or the peer-evaluation of classmates, programmed beforehand and that will sometimes clash with the willingness to compromise the deadlines that both the student body and teacher are accustomed to. The tension between the machine's strict workings and the more relaxed approach of the human group obliges us to -which washing machine in flight that has to be stopped to accept a delayed sock- make thankless decisions, about leaving out -until the next wash- certain individuals. My advice here returns to running more Workshops that award fewer marks, rather than running just one that decides everything and creates dramas dealing with inpunctualities.

The fourth is the difficulty is desiging good quality rubrics. While this book explains the technical configuration and good practices for using the digital tool, I'm afraid that this is the easiest bit of the process. Homer Simpson once said that he only knew three kinds of people; "those who can count and those who cannot..." Well, I only know two types of teacher: those who haven't designed a rubric yet, and those who already understand the difficulties inherent in desigining a good one. If you are still a member of the first group, I would urge you to join the second as soon as you can. And even though this is not a book about pedagogy, nor about measuring tools; nor does it claim any authority about the design of assessment rubrics; from the first chapter I will need to ask you that you edit at least one (see page 52) because it underpins absolutely everything else. Without a rubric, your Workshop has no foundations. It will be built on shifting sands. Really. Prepare your rubric first of all. If I could single out just one paragraph from this book to rescue from a burning building, it would be (without a shadow of a doubt) this one.

One final piece of bad news. If you haven't noticed already, your student cohort isn't going to be delighted to be marking their classmates' work. Even though, from the point of view of teaching we may feel more involved in our teaching mission, or put in this extra effort to implement collaborative teaching strategies and exercises rooted in deep learning... _blah, blah, blah_... watch out. Remember that your students are only going to hear one thing: 'more... work... to... do...' End of story. If you hoped that running Workshops would improve your scores in student satisfaction surveys* bear in mind that your students may feel differently. It may furl some brows... 'you're making us do your work for you'. For this reason, we must continuously strive to give the opposite message, using a communication strategy that makes it very clear that the teacher  is taking the process as seriously as they are, and that instead of the teacher abandoning their duties it is the complete opposite. We will need to imagine the tasks from their side and understand the conflicting interest of all parties with a little empathy and psychological ability.

That said:

I promise you, it is worth it. You are starting a fascinating journey. After twenty years in teaching, sometimes successful, sometimes not, I discovered computer-aided peer-assessment. I now feel, for the first time, that my time is spent building things that are truly worthwhile, and that shows results, week in, week out.

\* If you are really looking to improve scores in these surveys, I recommend you read The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs by Carmine Gallo [JD assuming that this is available in English?] and Brain Rules by the neurologise John Medina. Our audience is in the classroom [???] and these two books, though not specifically about teaching, caused a sea change in my lectures. What I picked up from these books worked from day one, but that is for another book...
