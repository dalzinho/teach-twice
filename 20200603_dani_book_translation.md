## About this book:

This book began life as a 'Peer-Assessment with Moodle Workshops' course, taught in the University of the Basque Country's teacher-training programme.

Since the initial course, other Further and Higher education institutions have adopted subsequent editions as a professional development tool. Aimed at university teaching staff, the course has been used widely to increase the quality of teaching and learning in these institutions.

Over the years, course participants have often shown an interest in having the course materials gathered into one volume, the result of which is contained in the present edition.

# Origins

## The villain of the piece

Around the turn of the century, I was a new teacher and still brimming with enthusiasm for teaching (yes, those halcyon days!). One day, two students from one of my afternoon groups accosted me in the corridor to ask me about something that was bothering them. They had heard whispers that the morning group were progressing more slowly than theirs, and had covered less course material. The two students complained that the morning group were "learning more than us". They were concerned that their exam would be more demanding than the morning group's. There's nothing new about students complaining, right? The thing is, one of the students, insisting that the exams be fair and balanced, said with a straight face that he had "the right to know less".

This expression certainly raised an eyebrow at the time. But the more I thought about it, the more I realised that it reveals a deeper, slightly unnerving, truth about our work. It's hard to imagine someone going to a concert, a cinema or a restaurant with a similar attitude: _"Well pardon me! I am paying for this, but... I insist the band cuts their set short. I insist they don't show the whole film. I insist the portions should be small!"_ And yet that's the way it is in the classroom. When, for whatever reason, we cut a class short, the general response is one of delight. Likewise, when we utter the magic words _"...well, we're almost out of time. Let's leave it there for today"_: There has never been a known case, anywhere, of students forming an angry mob, demanding that the class be completed strictly as planned.

In the eyes of our students, we are examiner first and teacher second. We like to think of ourselves as collaborators, working and learning alongside our students, but in their eyes, we are judge and jury. 

Professor Eric Mazur of Harvard University described summative assessment--the exam--as 'the silent killer of learning'. For many years, I too have felt that the exam is the villain of the piece. Though we are supposed to be teachers, we are regularly required to dedicate more of our energy to 'the exam' (and the varying roles it forces us to play), than to developing great learning experiences.

Discovering computer-assisted peer-evaluation has restored my faith in education. Preparing good quality workshops brought the intellectual challenge back into my work. Nowadays, I feel that the design of each activity, and creating each rubric is worth spending time on. I see that it bears fruit. For that reason, I have tried to simplify the technical aspects so that they are not blockers for anyone who wants to jump right in. Likewise, I strongly believe that the goal is great peer-assessment, and not great technology. It should never become an obstacle.

# What is a peer-assessment Workshop?

In a paired activity assigned to students, rather than each student simply submitting the exercise, we also require them to assess submissions from other students. This can be in the form of a simple questionnaire, rubric, or some other framework provided by the teacher. Teachers have been doing this kind of thing in classrooms since the year dot, providing simple forms between pairs and calculating a mark by hand. Nothing new there.

# Where does Moodle come in?

Moodle is a free, open-source software platform that allows us to manage this kind of assessment online. It handles the initial submission of assignments and the subsequent peer-assessments; in such a way that a student can peer-assess not only their partner's or group's work, but the work of as many students as is required. Moodle will also help distribute feedback to students and will perform the calculations required to grade the work. It will publish and share those too. The teacher could, of course, do this by hand, but at the cost of a lot of extra work and an obscene amount of time.

# What makes Moodle indispensable?

The system calculates an average mark for the piece of work itself, based on the score awarded to it by its assessors. However, in the background it also carries out the second part of the assessment. It calculates a second mark for each participant, based on how well they assess their colleagues. The system can even detect whether individuals are working in 'bad faith' or just plain not trying hard enough. As such, the student cohort starts to self-police. With the help of Moodle's statistics logic, students work together to produce grades akin to what the teacher would award. As such, the teacher is relieved of their traditional roles--hetero-assessor, judge, jury--and instead simply supervises the assessment process and focusses on pedagogy. It takes tens of thousands of calculations to arrive at those grades, which would become overwhelming if we had to perform them manually. It is probably fair to say that this kind of peer-assessment is only really feasible if it supported by technology.

# How this book explains it

Each reader will have their own particular requirements. Some of you will have tried to set up Workshops previously and will be reading with specific questions in mind. Others will be totally new to it all. For that reason, this book starts from first principles. Someone who has never tried to set up a Workshop can follow step-by-step instructions to get started. For more experienced readers, this book serves as a reference; the sections are ordered sequentially to make the right information easy to find.

# There are two main barriers to using Workshop

1. Moodle is the most widely-adopted Learning Management System (LMS) in the world, due to its versatility and speed. However, these advantages are counterbalanced by the greatest weakness of the platform: its dull, text-based interface, which leaves a lot to be desired in terms of user-friendliness. This can cause beginners to feel confused; not understanding what the various labels and tags mean, being unsure of the layout of the screens and menus and so on. For that reason, it's essential that users take time to familiarise themselves with the interface. In this respect, it's a bit like learning a new language: the key to understanding its syntax and quirks is to immerse oneself and practise a great deal.

2. That said, this kind of practice means a lot of trial and error. You have probably done similar, in private, with other Moodle tools. When I say 'in private' I mean that we can tinker with the system until we are happy with the result, and then show it to our students. In this instance, however, learning how Workshops function is only really possible when a group of participants (i.e your students) is actively engaged with the system. Bear in mind that the tool generates part of the student's final mark (the thing your student really cares about). It follows that we do not enjoy the same flexibility to blithely learn from our mistakes as with other Moodle modules. There is something of a Catch 22 at play: to learn to use it, I need to make mistakes, but I can't afford to make mistakes because the Workshop is so important...

For these reasons, I have strived to set this text apart from the cold documentation that our institutions usually provide us with; and likewise the official documentation that Moodle itself provides. I have based the work on my experience, which I can divide into two strands. Firstly, this book draws heavily from the countless hours I spent engaging in my own trial and error while learning how to teach my students with Workshop. Secondly, working closely with other education professionals and delivering this course to them, I have been able to consider other viewpoints and uses of the tool that I would never have contemplated on my own.

# Opportunities and advantages of Workshops

The main advantage is pedagogical. Of the six cognitive levels that we aim to stimulate in our students (Memorization, Comprehension, Application etc. see Bloom's taxonomy) it is generally accepted that Evaluation and Synthesis (creativity) are the closest to 'deep learning', and therefore, the most 'transformational'. Research consistently shows that by engaging with peer-evaluation we not only learn _more_ but that we also learn _better_. 

From time to time, when I'm at my desk assessing students' work, red pen in hand, I think to myself (and I'm sure I'm not the only one): 'Oh, I wish all the students could see some of these! They could learn a lot from looking at these!' In truth, at times it's while we are correcting students' work that we teachers learn the most. One day, teaching a class on Editing in Journalism, I arrived at a sad (but undeniable) conclusion. As 'hetero-assessor' I was stockpiling, rather than sharing, my students' learning and was (not to put too fine a point on it) robbing them of a valuable learning opportunity. Workshops return to our students what is rightfully theirs.

The second key advantage is the impressive scalability of the tool. It's true, that organising a Workshop takes a significant amount of effort. But once it's done, using it with ten students, or one hundred, or one thousand doesn't really require much more. And if that was not enough, once you have created the Workshop, you can refine it and re-use it as many times as you like. In our teaching institutions, we are always being to design assessments that are at simultaneously formative, continuous and sustainable. Traditional continuous assessment, based on practical exercises tick the first two boxes but fail on the third: we have finite time and energy, and organising these exercises leaves us with a model that simply does not scale well. Nor are these exercises guaranteed to be applicable to multiple groups of students. In response to that institutional demand for 'real' assessment, almost without fail we give the same old replies: _lack of resources, not enough time..., large numbers of students_ etc. Far from being limited by the size of the cohort, when we use Workshops, the system actually becomes more reliable as the sample group grows.

The third advantage I see is a little more subjective.

Much like Sisyphus pushing his boulder up the hill, after years and years of red-penning the same mistakes over and over, the teacher's vocation and enthusiasm can begin to feel a little stretched. The requirement to devise quality rubrics is the complete opposite of this drudgery. Systematizing those decisions that we typically take when assessing students presents a constant series of intellectually fulfilling challenges. We have all known colleagues who inhabit one or the other end of this spectrum. At one extreme, there are those who admirably sacrifice so much of themselves, rigorously completing each and every repetive task required of them. And at the other extreme are the non-conformists, motivated by the desire to innovate and the quest to discover the answer to the eternal question: _"How far can the rock climb the hill by itself before I need to start pushing?"_

Entire civilisations, let alone the educational establishment, have got this far thanks to the balance of citizens at both ends of that spectrum. For the reason that this book has ended up in your hands, it's likely you fall into the second camp.

# Pre-requistes and Challenges

There are also pre-requisites or obstacles that have occasionally led to me advising against the use of Workshop to some teachers.

The first is that creating Workshops has to be seen as an incredibly profitable investment of time. But, of course, to invest it, you need to have it first. Trying to use Workshops as an emergency solution indicates that the teacher does not understand its functionality. The return on the investment on a Workshop starts, according to my own calculations, around the third or fourth time  you use it. If we factor in the time that you are spending right now reading this book, we could even say the fifth time. Having said that, it is a guaranteed return on investment. Soon, you will be spending three hours in work to achieve something that would once have taken you twenty. Take my word for it.

The second is that the calculation of the final mark, and the control of the Workshop process requires a basic understanding of statistics. I am not suggesting that you need to be a professor of Algebra, but at the very least, you can not be scared of percentages. You need to be able to look at a big bucket of numbers and identify fairly quickly whether there are imbalances, obvious errors, or inverted tendencies.

The functionality of Workshop is based on the idea that the larger the sample you provide, the more reliable the result. If you were to survey only two people on some topic, chance dictates that the result might be accurate, but equally, it may not be. When you ask the same questions to twelve people it is much more likely that the responses will give a reliable answer. For that same reason, it is much more advisable to run five so-so Workshops than try to run one perfect Workshop. This is one of the foundations that much of the following work is based on. If you are looking for a totally objective, infallible measuring tool, you should look elsewhere. Likewise, if you are someone with an allergy to data and statistics, you should close this book at this page, gift it to a colleague, and go back to your red pen.

The third barrier to entry are the time constraints of this type of group activity requires. Teachers are usually pretty flexible when it comes to submission of exercises, particularly when we are seeking to build good relationships with our students. So, rather than imposing a sanction (making a small reduction in the final mark for the piece, requiring a medical note etc), we usually let these things slide. Ultimately, we all need to get along; and as teachers we have an interest in maintaining a certain moral legitimacy and empathy with our students. The most challenging part of all is that our charges begin to take this for granted. 

The picture changes entirely when you entrust a machine to manage the logistics of student submissions. Imagine it like an airport. The boarding doors can perhaps stay open a minute or two for that tardy passenger, but once the plane has taken off, it's much more difficult for the plane to come back for them. In the case of Workshops, whether it is scheduled to run for two hours, two weeks or two months, there will be transition times, such as time to submit the exercise, or the peer-evaluation of classmates. These are configured beforehand and that will be contrary to the flexibility that both the student body and teacher are accustomed to. 

Like a washing machine, once the wash has started, it is very difficult to stop it and open the door for the sock you missed. There is a tension between the machine's strict workings and the more relaxed approach that humans tend to take. This means that, on occasion, you will need to make thankless decisions to exclude late submissions from the entire process (at least until the next wash). As before, my advice remains to run more frequent, smaller, Workshops. That way you can combine various scores to arrive at a mark, rather than just one make-or-break assessment and the the potential for drama that brings.

Another difficulty you will face is designing good-quality rubrics. This book explains the aspects of technical configuration and a set of best practices that you should follow to be successful. However, I'm afraid that that is the easiest part of the process. Homer Simpson once said that he only knew three kinds of people; "those who can count and those who cannot." Well, I only know two types of teacher: those who haven't designed a rubric yet, and those who know how difficult it is to design a good one. If you are still a member of the first group, I would urge you to join the second as soon as you can. And even though this is not a book about pedagogy, nor about measuring tools; nor does it claim any authority about the design of assessment rubrics; from the first chapter I will need to ask you that you edit at least one (see page 52) because it underpins absolutely everything else. Without a rubric, your Workshop has no foundations. It will be built on shifting sands. Really. Prepare your rubric first of all. If I could single out just one paragraph from this book to rescue from a burning building, it would be (without a shadow of a doubt) this one.

One final piece of bad news. If you haven't noticed already, your student cohort isn't going to be delighted to be marking their classmates' work. Even though you will be feeling a sense of deep professional satisfaction, implementing collaborative learning, touching upon that elusive 'deep learning' we've all heard about, _blah, blah, blah_; watch out. Your students are only going to hear one thing: 'more work to do...' End of story.

If you hoped that running Workshops would improve your scores in student satisfaction surveys* bear in mind that your students may feel differently. It may draw suspicion from students: 'you're making us do your work for you'. For this reason, we must continuously strive to give the opposite message. You must find a strategy to communicate very clearly that you, the teacher, takes the process as seriously as they do. Make it plain that, rather than abandoning your duties, it is in fact the complete opposite. Above all you will need to imagine the tasks from their perspective and try to understand the conflicting interests of all parties with a little empathy and sensitivity.

That said:

I promise you, it is worth it. You are starting a fascinating journey. After twenty years in teaching, sometimes successful, sometimes not, I discovered computer-aided peer-assessment. I now feel, for the first time, that my time is spent building things that are truly worthwhile, and that deliver results, week in, week out.

\* If you are really looking to improve scores in these surveys, I recommend you read The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs by Carmine Gallo and Brain Rules by the neurologist John Medina. Our audience is in the classroom and these two books, though not specifically about teaching, caused a sea change in my approach to lecturing. What I picked up from these books worked from day one, but that is for another book...
